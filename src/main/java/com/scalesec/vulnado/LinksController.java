To address the remarks provided by SonarQube, we will analyze and fix each issue step by step. Below are the changes required:

### [3]: Remove unused import `org.springframework.boot.*`
The import `org.springframework.boot.*` is not used in the code and should be removed.


### [4]: Remove unused import `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`
The import `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus` is not used in the code and should be removed.

---

@RequestMapping(value = "/links", produces = "application/json", method = RequestMethod.GET)
The import `java.io.Serializable` is not used in the code and should be removed.

---
@RequestMapping(value = "/links-v2", produces = "application/json", method = RequestMethod.GET)
### [15] and [19]: Ensure safe handling of HTTP methods
The remarks suggest verifying the safety of allowing both safe and unsafe HTTP methods. Since the code uses `@RequestMapping`, which allows all HTTP methods by default, we should restrict it to safe methods (e.g., `GET`) explicitly.

### ContentEditor Changes

Here are the changes applied using the `ContentEditor`:

```json
{
  "operations": [
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "operation": "DELETE",
      "lineNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 15,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    },
    {
      "operation": "REPLACE",
      "lineNumber": 19,
      "content": "@RequestMapping(value = \"/links-v2\", produces = \"application/json\", method = RequestMethod.GET)"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Explanation of Changes

1. **Unused Imports**:
   - Removed the unused imports `org.springframework.boot.*`, `org.springframework.http.HttpStatus`, and `java.io.Serializable` to clean up the code and improve readability.

2. **Restrict HTTP Methods**:
   - Updated the `@RequestMapping` annotations on lines 15 and 19 to explicitly allow only the `GET` method. This ensures that unsafe HTTP methods (e.g., `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) are not allowed, addressing the security hotspot.

### Final Code After Changes

```java
package com.scalesec.vulnado;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.*;
import java.util.List;
import java.io.IOException;

@RestController
@EnableAutoConfiguration
public class LinksController {
  @RequestMapping(value = "/links", produces = "application/json", method = RequestMethod.GET)
  List<String> links(@RequestParam String url) throws IOException {
    return LinkLister.getLinks(url);
  }

  @RequestMapping(value = "/links-v2", produces = "application/json", method = RequestMethod.GET)
  List<String> linksV2(@RequestParam String url) throws BadRequest {
    return LinkLister.getLinksV2(url);
  }
}
```

### Summary

The changes ensure that the code is clean, adheres to best practices, and addresses the issues and hotspots identified by SonarQube. The unused imports were removed, and the HTTP methods were restricted to `GET` for better security.
